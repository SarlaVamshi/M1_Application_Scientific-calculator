High Level  REquirements:-

Scientific calculators are planned with specific tasks such as integration, addition, multiplication, matrix and logarithms built in.
 
Present scientific calculators commonly have more features than an everyday calculator. The feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the main features of a scientific calculator include:
scientific notation
floating point arithmetic
logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e
Antilogarithmic functions
trigonometric functions
exponential functions and roots beyond the square root
access to constants such as pi (3.14 ) and e
 Low Level Requirements:-
 
 
In addition, high-end scientific calculators will include:
hexadecimal, binary, and octal calculations, including basic Boolean Algebra
complex numbers
fractions
Inverse
statistics and probability calculations
programmability
equation solving ( two variables & three variables )
calculus
conversion of units
physical constants
