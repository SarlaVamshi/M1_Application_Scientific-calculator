Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include:

scientific notation
floating-point arithmetic
logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e
trigonometric functions (some including hyperbolic trigonometry)
exponential functions and roots beyond the square root
quick access to constants such as pi and e
In addition, high-end scientific calculators generally include:
cursor controls to edit equations and view previous calculations (some calculators such as the LCD-8310, badge engineered under both Olympia and United Office keep the number of the previous result on-screen for convenience while the new calculation is being entered.[1])
hexadecimal, binary, and octal calculations, including basic Boolean mathematics
complex numbers
fractions calculations
statistics and probability calculations
programmability â€” see Programmable calculator
equation solving
matrix calculations
calculus
letters that can be used for spelling words or including variables into an equation
conversion of units
physical constants
