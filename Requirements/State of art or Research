The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic ideas above was the programmable Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A,[2] released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron[3] had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs. 
The HP-9100 series was built entirely from discrete transistor logic with no integrated circuits, and was one of the first uses of the CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first calculator based on reverse Polish notation (RPN) entry
